# Crop Recommendation System using AI/Ml
This project is designed to provide smart agricultural solutions using machine learning. It analyses soil properties, weather conditions, and crop requirements to recommend the most suitable crops and fertilizers for optimal yield. By leveraging data-driven insights, the system aims to enhance productivity and support sustainable farming practices.

📊 Week 1 - Completed Tasks:
✅ Loaded Crop & Fertilizer Datasets
✅ Checked for missing values & null entries
✅ Analyzed data distributions to understand trends
📈 Initial Data Interpretation
✅ Identified important features (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall)
✅ Found common crop requirements based on soil conditions
✅ Observed fertilizer usage patterns

📊 Week 2 - Data Visualization & Insights:

1️⃣ Feature Distribution Analysis:
✅ Used Histograms (histplot) to visualize:
-> Distribution of N, P, K levels in soil
-> Variability in temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall
-> Fertilizer type frequency in the dataset

2️⃣ Relationship Between Features:
✅ Scatter Plots to analyze:
-> Temperature vs. Humidity → Impact on crop growth
-> Soil pH vs. Crop Type → Identifying pH-tolerant crops
-> Rainfall vs. Crop Yield → Checking water dependency

3️⃣ Box Plots for Outlier Detection:
✅ Used Box Plots to identify outliers in:
-> Soil Nutrient Levels (N, P, K)
-> Temperature, Humidity, Rainfall variations
-> Fertilizer application patterns

4️⃣ Correlation Heatmaps:
✅ Used Seaborn Heatmaps to analyze feature correlations
✅ Identified highly correlated variables that impact crop selection
✅ Found dependencies between soil nutrients & fertilizer requirements
